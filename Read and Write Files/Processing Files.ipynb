    "CONCEPT: The data that is stored in a file is frequently organized in records. A record is a complete set of data about an item, and a field is an individual piece of data within a record. When data is written to a file, it is often organized into records and fields. A record is a complete set of data that describes one item, and a field is a single piece of data within a record."
