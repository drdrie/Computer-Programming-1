    "<code>and</code> - The and operator connects two Boolean expressions into one compound expression. Both subexpressions must be true for the compound expression to be true. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>or</code>  - The or operator connects two Boolean expressions into one compound expression. One or both subexpressions must be true for the compound expression to be true. It is only necessary for one of the subexpressions to be true, and it does not matter which. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>not</code>  - The not operator is a unary operator, meaning it works with only one operand. The operand must be a Boolean expression. The not operator reverses the truth of its operand. If it is applied to an expression that is true, the operator returns false. If it is applied to an expression that is false, the operator returns true.\n",
